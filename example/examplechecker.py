    Magic.

    A few convenient methods and helpers are provided in the BaseChecker.
    ensure_bytes ans ensure_unicode to make sure strings are always equal.

    As well as methods:
    self.connect() connects to the remote server.
    self.get and self.post request from http.
    self.team_db is a dict that stores its contents to filesystem. (call .persist() to make sure)
    self.readline_expect(): fails if it's not read correctly
