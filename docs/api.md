# enochecker.enochecker

## parse_args
```python
parse_args(argv=None)
```

Returns the parsed argparser args.
Args look like this:
[
    "StoreFlag|RetrieveFlag|StoreNoise|RetrieveNoise|Havoc", [Task type]
    "$Address", [Address, either IP or domain]
    "$TeamName",
    "$Round",
    "$Flag|$Noise",
    "$MaxRunningTime",
    "$CallIdx" [index of this task (for each type) in the current tick]
]
:param argv: argv. Custom argvs. Will default to sys.argv if not provided.
:return: args object

## BaseChecker
```python
BaseChecker(self, method=None, address=None, team_name=None, round=None, flag=None, call_idx=None, max_time=None, port=None, storage_dir='C:\\Users\\DMaier\\tmp\\enochecker\\src\\.data', from_args=True)
```

All you base are belong to us. Also all your flags. And checker scripts.
Override the methods given here, then simply init and .run().
Magic.

### global_db

A global storage shared between all teams and rounds.
Subsequent calls will return the same db.
Prefer db_team_local or db_round_local
:return: The global db

### http_useragent

The useragent for http(s) requests
:return: the current useragent

### noise

Pretty similar to a flag, just in a different mode (storeNoise vs storeFlag)
:return: The noise

### team_db

The database for the current team
:return: The team local db

### run
```python
BaseChecker.run(self, method=None)
```

Executes the checker and catches errors along the way.
:param method: When calling run, you may call a different method than the one passed on Checker creation
                using this optional param.
:return: the Result code as int, as per the Result enum.

### putflag
```python
BaseChecker.putflag(self)
```

This method stores a flag in the service.
In case multiple flags are provided, self.call_idx gives the appropriate index.
The flag itself can be retrieved from self.flag.
On error, raise an Eno Exception.
:raises EnoException on error
:return this function can return a result if it wants
        if nothing is returned, the service status is considered okay.
        the preferred way to report errors in the service is by raising an appropriate enoexception

### getflag
```python
BaseChecker.getflag(self)
```

This method retrieves a flag from the service.
Use self.flag to get the flag that needs to be recovered and self.tick to get the tick the flag was placed in.
On error, raise an EnoException.
:raises EnoException on error
:return this function can return a result if it wants
        if nothing is returned, the service status is considered okay.
        the preferred way to report errors in the service is by raising an appropriate enoexception

### putnoise
```python
BaseChecker.putnoise(self)
```

This method stores noise in the service. The noise should later be recoverable.
The difference between noise and flag is, tht noise does not have to remain secret for other teams.
This method can be called many times per round. Check how often using self.call_idx.
On error, raise an EnoException.
:raises EnoException on error
:return this function can return a result if it wants
        if nothing is returned, the service status is considered okay.
        the preferred way to report errors in the service is by raising an appropriate enoexception

### getnoise
```python
BaseChecker.getnoise(self)
```

This method retrieves noise in the service.
The noise to be retrieved is inside self.flag
The difference between noise and flag is, tht noise does not have to remain secret for other teams.
This method can be called many times per round. Check how often using call_idx.
On error, raise an EnoException.
:raises EnoException on error
:return this function can return a result if it wants
        if nothing is returned, the service status is considered okay.
        the preferred way to report errors in the service is by raising an appropriate enoexception

### havoc
```python
BaseChecker.havoc(self)
```

This method unleashes havoc on the app -> Do whatever you must to prove the service still works. Or not.
On error, raise an EnoException.
:raises EnoException on Error
:return This function can return a result if it wants
        If nothing is returned, the service status is considered okay.
        The preferred way to report Errors in the service is by raising an appropriate EnoException

### db
```python
BaseChecker.db(self, name, ignore_locks=False)
```

Get a (global) db by name
Subsequent calls will return the same db.
Names can be anything, for example the team name, round numbers etc.
:param name: The name of the DB
:param ignore_locks: Should only be set if you're sure-ish keys are never shared between instances.
        Manual locking ist still possible.
:return: A dict that will be self storing. Alternatively,

### get_team_db
```python
BaseChecker.get_team_db(self, team=None)
```

Returns the database for a specific team.
Subsequent calls will return the same db.
:param team: Return a db for an other team. If none, the db for the local team will be returned.
:return: The team local db

### connect
```python
BaseChecker.connect(self, host=None, port=None, timeout=None)
```

Opens a socket/telnet connection to the remote host.
Use connect(..).get_socket() for the raw socket.
:param host: the host to connect to (defaults to self.address)
:param port: the port to connect to (defaults to self.port)
:param timeout: timeout on connection (defaults to self.max_time)
:return: A connected Telnet instance

### http_useragent_randomize
```python
BaseChecker.http_useragent_randomize(self)
